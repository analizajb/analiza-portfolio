        As a child, I've always had an intense interest for technology; whether
        it was learning the ins and outs of a computers file system or messing
        with the camera settings on my Dad's video camera. Then, as a young teen
        I first encountered coding when vamping up my MySpace profile (if you
        know, you know) but as time went on, I slowly pulled away. Last year, my
        son's teacher encouraged his students to learn coding. In the process of
        ensuring my son participated in the coding apps provided, that old love
        I had for learning technology was fiercely reignited.
        <br></br>
        Soon enough, I took a giant leap and enrolled for the Full Stack Coding
        bootcamp through UC Davis. Today, I find myself graduated. Certified.
        Full Stack! I could write that "I can't believe I did it..." - but I
        truly can! I refuse to let that imposter syndrome consume me. It's
        because of that curious little girl rooted in my being that made this
        possible and so, here I am with all these tools I've become familiar
        with and skills I'm ready to show. I have proficient capabilities in
        HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, React, SQL, Figma and so many more.
        <br></br>
        Now, computers and coding aside, I have a strong passion for growing the
        majority of our produce and currently loving the bounty of tomatoes I
        have going. I'm an avid crafter and if you give me the slightest
        impression you do too, I will probably talk your ear off. Knitting,
        sewing, crocheting are my absolute favorite crafts. These two passions
        sparked the idea behind two group projects I completed that you can find
        on my Projects page!
